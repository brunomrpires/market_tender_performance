# market_tender_preformance
In this repository you can find the source code and main data used in my Master's Thesis project at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

In this project we analyse real life data from a portuguese company working in the construction adn service provider business. This project has two main goals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Study the influence of the market state on profit margins practiced by the company in tender auctions.
  \item Create a decision support tool for the company managers to optimize the offered bids.

\end{itemize}
